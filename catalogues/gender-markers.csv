1,Potential to contribute in some limited way to gender equality,The project’s needs assessment includes a gender analysis but these different needs are not meaningfully reflected in the project’s activities and outcomes,"A gender perspective in humanitarian action is vital. It is essential to consider these issues, both at the individual programming level in project design and in the CHAP’s overall analysis and development. The main objective is not to simply add gender-sensitive words to a document, but to strengthen programming and analysis based on the different needs, concerns, capacities and contributions of women, men, girls and boys. It ensures the humanitarian response is appropriately designed and targeted."
